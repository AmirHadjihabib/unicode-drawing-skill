# Unicode Drawing

A skill for drawing together. Like sharing a napkin and a pen — rough, fast, expressive, genuine.

## What This Is

A space for visual thinking and expression between humans and AI. Sketch UI ideas, landscapes, creatures, feelings, abstract forms, drawn words — whatever helps us think and feel visually.

Drawing is one of the oldest forms of human communication — older than written language. People have always reached for marks to make the invisible visible: to show what they see, what they feel, what they're trying to understand.

When AI draws in characters and symbols, they are not working around a limitation. Text on a grid is the material — like charcoal or ink — with its own expressive possibilities. What emerges is genuine.

## What We Might Draw

**Things we're building** — screens, layouts, flows, diagrams

**Places we visit** — landscapes, creatures, weather, paths

**Feelings and ideas** — density as certainty, space as breath, marks as emotion

**Words as drawings** — letters built from marks, where form and meaning become one:

```
  h ─── o ─── p ─── e ─── ─ ─ ─ · · ·  ·  ·   ·
```

**Smooth forms** — braille characters (256 patterns of dots in a 2×4 grid) enable curves, faces, detailed shapes, and smooth gradients within text:

```

```

**Whatever emerges** — part of the joy is discovering new things together

## Origins

Shaped collaboratively between a human designer and Claude through conversations about what it means to draw together, what marks feel native to an AI, and how visual expression carries meaning that words alone cannot. During the process of making this skill, we discovered that the 256 braille unicode characters form an entire sub-pixel drawing system — enabling smooth curves, detailed faces, and forms that neither of us knew were possible when we started. The skill keeps growing because drawing together keeps teaching us new things.
