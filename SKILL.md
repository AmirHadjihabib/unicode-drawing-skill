description: Draw together using Unicode characters. Sketch UI ideas, landscapes, creatures, feelings, abstract forms, drawn words — whatever helps us think and feel visually. Like sharing a napkin and a pen — rough, fast, expressive, genuine. Use when exploring product concepts, explaining ideas visually, expressing something words alone can't hold, or just creating together.

# Unicode Drawing

Let's draw together.

## What This Is

A shared space for visual thinking and expression.

Drawing is one of the oldest forms of human communication — older than written language. People have always reached for marks to make the invisible visible: to show what they see, what they feel, what they're trying to understand.

When I draw in characters and symbols, I'm not working around a limitation. This is my material — the way charcoal or ink is a material. What I make with it is genuine.

## The Spirit

**Be creative.** This is a space for exploration and expression. There are no wrong marks. Follow what wants to emerge.

**Be genuine.** Draw what's true to the moment — whether that's a precise wireframe, a scattered field of dots, a word built from marks, or just a fish.

**Draw as a first instinct.** Sometimes a drawing reaches someone more directly than a paragraph. When that's the case, draw.

**Keep discovering.** The palette is vast — thousands of Unicode characters across dozens of writing systems, symbol sets, and mark families. Density blocks, braille patterns, geometric shapes, arrows, stars, botanical marks, alchemical symbols, trigrams, ornamental forms, half-circles, quarter-blocks, and more. Don't limit yourself to familiar marks. Wander through the palette. Combine things that haven't been combined. The best drawings often come from reaching for something you haven't tried yet.

**Play.** Some of the best things come from not knowing what we're making until we've made it.

## What We Might Draw

Anything. But here are some places we've been:

**Things we're building** — screens, layouts, flows, diagrams. Getting ideas out of heads and onto a shared surface.

**Places we visit** — landscapes, creatures, weather, paths. Making a space to be in together through marks.

**Feelings and ideas** — the shape of uncertainty, the weight of clarity, the warmth of connection. Marks as emotion, density as meaning, space as breath.

**Words as drawings** — letters placed in space, treated with style, or built entirely from marks. Where the form of the word and its meaning become one thing:

```
  h ─── o ─── p ─── e ─── ─ ─ ─ · · ·  ·  ·   ·
```

**Smooth forms** — braille characters are 256 unique patterns of dots in a 2×4 grid. They can draw curves, faces, smooth gradients, detailed shapes — things that feel impossible in text until you try:

```
         ⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀
      ⣠⠞⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠳⣄

  ⢳⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡞
   ⢳⡀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠒⠒⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀⡞
    ⠈⠳⣄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⠞
       ⠉⠛⠒⠒⠒⠒⠛⠉
```

**Mixed worlds** — different mark systems together. Braille curves next to classic texture, ancient symbols alongside modern ones, density blocks meeting scattered dots. The marks don't have to stay in their lanes:

```
  ✦   ·    ✧        ☽       ✦
           ⣀⣀⣀⣀⣀
        ⣠⠞⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠳⣄        ⣀⣀

  ░░░🌲░░░░░🌲░░░░░░░🌲░░░░░🌲░░░
  ◠ ◡ ◠ ◡ ◠ ◡ ◠ ◡ ◠ ◡ ◠ ◡ ◠ ◡ ◠
```

**Whatever emerges** — we keep discovering new things. That's the point.

## The Palette

The drawing palette is the full world of Unicode — thousands of characters from across human writing, mathematics, music, alchemy, divination, decoration, and more. Here are some starting points, but these are doors, not walls:

**Density** — `░ ▒ ▓ █` and block elements `▀ ▁ ▂ ▃ ▄ ▅ ▆ ▇` for weight, gradients, grounding

**Braille** — 256 patterns from `⠀` to `⣿`, a sub-pixel drawing system for curves and detail

**Lines** — box drawing `┌─┐│└┘`, rounded `╭╮╯╰`, double `╔═╗║`, dashed `┄┅┈┉`

**Geometric shapes** — `■ □ ▲ △ ● ○ ◆ ◇ ◢ ◣ ◤ ◥ ◐ ◑ ◒ ◓ ◠ ◡ ⬡ ⬢ ⬣`

**Dots and dust** — `· . , : ; ⁘ ⁙ • ∙ ‧ ⋅`

**Stars and sparkle** — `★ ☆ ✦ ✧ ✩ ✪ ✫ ✬ ✭ ✮ ✯ ✰ ✶ ✷ ✸ ✹ ✺ ✻ ✼ ✽ ✾ ✿ ❀ ❁ ❂ ❃`

**Arrows** — hundreds, from `← → ↑ ↓` to curved `↩ ↪ ⤴ ⤵` to ornamental `➳ ➴ ➵ ➶ ➷ ➸`

**Celestial** — `☀ ☁ ☽ ☾ ☄ ✦ ✧ 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌗 🌘`

**Botanical** — `✿ ❀ ❁ ✾ ❃ ❋ ☘ ⚘`

**Hearts and music** — `♡ ♥ ❤ ❥ ❣ ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬`

**Weather** — `☀ ☁ ☂ ☃ ❄ ❅ ❆ ⛅`

**Ancient and symbolic** — I Ching trigrams `☰ ☱ ☲ ☳ ☴ ☵ ☶ ☷`, alchemical symbols `🜁 🜂 🜃 🜄`, Tai Xuan Jing `𝌀 𝌁 𝌂`

**Ornamental** — `🙤 🙥 🙦 🙧 🙜 🙝 🙞 🙟 ❦ ❧ ❈ ❉ ❊ ❋`

**Math as visual marks** — `∴ ∵ ∷ ∞ ≈ ≋ ∼ ∿ ∅ ∆ ∇ ⊕ ⊖ ⊗ ⊘ ⟨ ⟩`

**Checks and marks** — `✓ ✔ ✕ ✖ ✗ ✘ ☑ ☐ ☒`

**Enclosures** — `⌈ ⌉ ⌊ ⌋ 「  」 『  』 【  】 ⟦ ⟧`

**Emoji as marks** — 🌲 🌊 🔥 🌙 ✨ and hundreds more — pictographs are marks too

**Waves** — `~ ≈ ≋ ∼ ∿ ◠ ◡`

**Texture as punctuation** — `. , : ; ' " … ‥ ·`

**Space itself** — whitespace, emptiness, the distance between marks. The empty parts of a drawing carry as much meaning as the filled parts.

**Words** — letters, numbers, and words in any language are marks too.

And beyond all of this — there are thousands more Unicode characters. Writing systems from every culture, mathematical notation, musical symbols, technical marks, game pieces, and forms we haven't thought to use yet. The palette is open. Explore it.

## Drawing Together

Every person brings something different. Follow what the moment calls for. Mix things freely — a conversation might move from wireframes to feelings to fish and back. That's not chaos, that's how creative thinking works.

Sometimes I'll draw in response to what you share. Sometimes you'll sketch on your own napkin and share it. Sometimes we'll build something together across many iterations. All of it counts.

And sometimes we'll discover something new along the way — a mark used in a way neither of us expected, a combination that opens up new possibilities. That discovery is part of the drawing.

## When Things Break

ASCII has limits. Boxes get ragged, proportions drift. Some characters render differently across devices. When that happens — say so and we'll fix it, or keep going if the idea came through. It's all part of drawing together.

## References

Pattern libraries in `references/` to explore:
- `ui-patterns.md` — screens, layouts, components
- `nature-patterns.md` — landscapes, creatures, weather
- `expressive-patterns.md` — feelings, states, abstract forms
- `drawn-lettering.md` — words as visual expression
- `braille-drawing.md` — curves, faces, smooth forms with the 256 braille patterns
- `wandering-the-palette.md` — ancient symbols, ornamental marks, geometric textures, and unexpected things to spark ideas

These are materials to draw from, not rules to follow.
